% Smart contracts are programs running on top of blockchain platforms. They
% interact with each other through well-defined interfaces to perform financial
% transactions in a distributed system with no trusted third parties. But these
% interfaces also provide a favorable setting for attackers, who can exploit
% security vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
%to achieve financial gain. 

This paper presents \toolname, a system for automatic synthesis of adversarial
contracts that exploit vulnerabilities in a victim smart contract.
To make the synthesis tractable, we introduce a query language as well as \emph{summary-based
symbolic evaluation}, which significantly reduces the number of instructions
that our synthesizer needs to evaluate symbolically, without compromising the
precision of the vulnerability query. We encoded common
vulnerabilities of smart contracts and evaluated
\toolname on the entire data set from \etherscan. 
%with $>$25K smart contracts. 
Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of summary-based symbolic evaluation and
show that \toolname outperforms state-of-the-art smart contracts analyzers,
\teether, \mythril, and \contractfuzz, in terms of running time, precision, and soundness.\looseness=-1
