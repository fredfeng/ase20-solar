To understand the impact of our summary-based symbolic evaluation described 
in Section~\ref{sec:sum} and how are queries of different granularity related to the performance, we run \toolname on the \etherscan data set with different queries. In particular, $\vulnerability$ denotes the approximate query discussed in Section~\ref{sec:vul}, and $\vulnerability^{\diamond}$ corresponds to more precise queries adopted from the previous work~\cite{Hirai17}. Specifically, the more precise queries in $\vulnerability^{\diamond}$ include not only constraints in $\vulnerability$ but also extra constraints that encode the invariant of storage balance. In other words, $\vulnerability^{\diamond}$ implies $\vulnerability$ (I.e., $\vulnerability^{\diamond} \implies \vulnerability$).
To speed up the evaluation, for both settings, we enable the
parallel synthesis optimization discussed in Section~\ref{sec:impl}.

Table~\ref{tbl:summary} shows the results of running \toolname with 
different settings and a time limit of 10 minutes. In particular, for the \reentrancy client, the approximate query $\vulnerability$ discussed in Section~\ref{sec:vul} has an average running time of 9 seconds while a precise query $\vulnerability^{\diamond}$ has to run for 52 seconds on average. Looking into the results closely, the approximate query $\vulnerability$ significantly reduces the size of the summaries. Specifically, $\vulnerability$ evaluates about 451 instructions on average while $\vulnerability^{\diamond}$ has to evaluate 1762 instructions on average. As a result, $\vulnerability^{\diamond}$ generates more false negatives (i.e., 23\% vs. 7\%) because it fails to explore enough search space within the time limit. On the other hand, although $\vulnerability$ is less precise, its false positive rate is very close to the one in $\vulnerability^{\diamond}$ (i.e., 3\% vs. 1\%). In the \batchoverflow client, we observe a similar trend.

% Each dot in the 
% figure represents the pairwise running time of a specific benchmark under different 
% settings; a dot near the diagonal indicates that the performance of 
% two settings is similar. Our summary-based symbolic
% evaluation significantly outperforms the baseline (i.e., non-summary) in the vast majority of benchmarks.
% As shown in Table~\ref{fig:summary},  if we exclude the benchmarks that timeout
% in 10 minutes, the mean time of our summary-based symbolic evaluation is only 8
% seconds, while it takes 35 seconds without computing the summary. Furthermore,
% 1846 benchmarks time out for both settings, and only 548 benchmarks time out on
% $S^{\dagger}$ but not on $S^{\diamond}$. However, without computing the summary,
% 17454 (i.e., 69.8\%) benchmarks time out. The result confirms that the
% summary-based technique is key to the efficiency of \toolname.\looseness=-1
% the running time of each benchmark under two different settings, and 
% the x-axis and y-axis represent the running time with and without computing 
% the summary, respectively. In particular, without computing the summary, on average
% it takes our tool \todo{XX} seconds to solve each benchmark and \todo{YY}
% benchmarks fail to terminate within a \todo{6} mins timeout. On the other hand, 
% the performance of our summary-based technique \emph{significantly} outperforms

{\bf Result for RQ2:}
Summary-based technique is key to the efficiency of \toolname. In the meantime, the approximate queries enable \toolname to generate smaller summaries, which leads to much better scalability in exchange of a minor loss in precision.
