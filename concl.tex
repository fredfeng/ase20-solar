\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}
This paper presented \toolname, a tool for automatic synthesis of adversarial
contracts that exploit vulnerabilities in a victim smart contract. To make
synthesis tractable, \toolname introduces \emph{summary-based symbolic
evaluation}, which enables our tool to perform precise all-paths analysis of
large real-world contracts, while significantly reducing the number of paths
that need to be executed symbolically. \toolname also introduces optimizations
to partition the synthesis search space for parallel exploration. %and to prune infeasible attack candidates earlier. 
Evaluating \toolname on the entire
\etherscan data set, we find that it significantly outperforms  state-of-the-art
analyzers in terms of precision and execution time.\looseness=-1
